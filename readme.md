-- For now this is what we have, well the changes and the update begins the file and this document will also track the changes of it. 

--- Having a problem witht the undo and the redo. We have to track the previous positions and the current positions and switch between it. 
--- How to do change that? 


--- Work flow of the undo and the redo....;

    Create arrays and store the item and the words into the text phase. ['']

    like this. 
    []
    ['','man'] the man is typed and we put this into the list. 
    and then we have to bring arrays valeus back and forward so we have to get the index value of this. initally the index value is the 0; 
    and as the user click the undo and redo. Then the functionallity will be executed; 
    Undo  ---> decrement--; 
    Redo  ----> increment++; 

    if the user click the undo => index will decrement and when the index will decreemnt it will give the previous value; and vise verca;
